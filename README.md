# ClinicDemo

This is the demo that I made for the code test. The front end is implemented with React Native and Expo. I implemented different screens and navigators, and I also realized functions like form validation at the front end, authentication and authorization(using a "fake" backend).

### This is the welcome screen and login screen.

### This is a brief tour of different screens(records feed, record editing, and account) after logging in. Logging out is also realized.

### This is the registration process. Form validation is implemented in the frontend. As the backend server is not completely implemented, the registration cannot successfully realized.

### This is the record adding process, which is similar as the previous one. As the backend server is not completely implemented, the adding cannot successfully realized.
